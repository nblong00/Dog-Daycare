# Dog-Daycare

This repositry contains a Dog Daycare adminstration program. I'm working to have multiple local relational database tables in use containing dogs, owners, purchases, and monthly subscription members. 

Assuming you have Python 3 installed, you just need to run the below commands in a Command Prompt window (Terminal on MAC) to install the needed resources to run the program:

* pip install sqlalchemy
